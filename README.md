## The game

You’re playing as the commander of a Swedish submarine named HMS Sven. By accident, you’ve managed to dive too deep into parts of the ocean where no light comes through and you need to get back up to the correct depth again.
While ascending, you’ll face different obstacles that you must avoid at all costs.

### How to play

Navigate the deep waters with the arrow keys on your keyboard. You can use Z and X to pivot your ship left and right.
You will face some obstacles on your way to the surface. We've heard reports of big icebergs as well as old naval mines floating around in the dark ocean. HMS Sven should withstand some hull damage from icebergs but don't push your luck with the mines. In case of emergency, look for so-called powerups. They might come in handy.
You have to rely on your sonar to be able to see anything down there. Be careful, every move may be your last.
Best of luck, Captain.
